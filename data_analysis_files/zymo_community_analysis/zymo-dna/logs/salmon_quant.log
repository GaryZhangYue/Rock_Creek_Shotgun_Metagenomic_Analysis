[2022-04-19 17:37:58.440] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2,099,896 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-04-19 17:37:58.481] [jointLog] [warning] 0.060137% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 21.
